Abstract:
Efficient operation and planning of public transit systems are crucial for urban sus- tainability. This study aims to analyze the impact of COVID-19, the expansion of the Transport for London (TfL) transit system, and changes in workplace norms on pas- senger demand and behaviour by creating advanced visualisations for the NUMBAT dataset published by TfL. This work also seeks to drive future research by augmenting the NUMBAT dataset with other data and publishing results. This work has found several insights: COVID-19 significantly altered travel behaviour and demand, with a persistent reduction in system load through 2022 compared to pre-pandemic levels. The Canary Wharf-Stratford connections on the Jubilee Line transformed from being pre- dominantly used for leisure to commuter traffic. The introduction of new lines, such as the Elizabeth Line, redistributed passenger volume but did not significantly change travel patterns. This study contributes to the ongoing discourse on the impact of exter- nal factors on public transit systems and offers a state-of-the-art visualization toolkit, available on GitHub [1], for further research and analysis, as well as data not available from other public sources. Future studies could expand on this work with new data from TfL showing accurate ride information or by creating a more user-friendly web application.
